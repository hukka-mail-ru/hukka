seen on the starwars-rpg.net website. That site suffered a MAJOR server
meltdown, and its Archives dissipeared. I have retyped and redone
graphics from what I had written from the site, and am sharing them
here. The info there was too good to be lost.<br>

<p>Following Sabacc, Holochess is generally considered the galaxy’s
second most popular game. It is a favorite of spacers and aristocrats
alike, and this diverse spectrum of players has also lead to a wide
array of variations that have become popular within the many niches of
society. Detailed here are two of the most well-known (and most
dissimilar) versions: Dejarik, a brutal gladiatorial contest of chance
and positioning, and Coutier, a deceptive simple game of pure strategy.</p>

<p>Much like Sabacc, the origins of holochess are a subject of much
dispute. All agree that the game began at the time even before modern
holographic technology, but no one seems to be able to pinpoint exactly
where it began.</p>

<p>The Corellians insist that the game was invented by their ancient
ocean explorers, and that as their early spaceships were under
development, the game pieces were converted to holograms so that it
could be played in zero-g. The Corellians say that the original game
was much like Dejarik. Conversely, both the Alderaanians and the
Coruscanti say that the game was invented by their respective palace
guardsmen, to pass the time while on watch. They say that variants like
Courier and Chambers are the game’s most direct descendants.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the Duro have a similar game, known as Lai Kyedts,
which has been an important part of their culture long before the
invention of the hyperdrive, and many scholars now believe that it was <i>this</i> game, not any game designed by humans, that was the true predecessor to modern holochess.</p>
<b>Players:<p></p>
</b>
<p>Holochess is usually played by two, through variations do exist for  three and four players.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image2.gif" height="181" width="181"><br>

<b><p>The Board: </p>
</b></p><p>The Holochess board is made up of a large circle about a
half meter in diameter. The board is divided into three concentric
circles, called orbits. The central circle is always white. The outer
orbits are divided into twelve equal segments, known as rays, which are
colored alternately black and white. <u>See Diagram 1</u>.</p>

<b><u><p>Rules of Dejarik:</p>
</u>
</b><p>Dejarik is played with a set of eight pieces, each of which has
unique movement, defensive and offensive capabilities. The players sit
on opposite sides of the board, and each control four of the
holographic combatants.</p>

<p>The Traditional pieces, and their prospective ratings, are as follows:</p>
<p>There are two power pieces in a traditional Dejarik set, the
Mantellian Savrip and the Monnok. Power pieces have high ratings in all
three capabilities.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/Image3.gif" height="130" width="192">The Savrip has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 6, <b>Defense</b> 6, <b>Movement</b> 2.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image4.gif" height="139" width="182">The Monnok has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 6, <b>Defense</b> 5, <b>Movement</b> 3.</p>

<p>Besides this, there are two Mid pieces, the Ghhhk and the Houjix, which have mid-range ratings in all three capabilities.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/Image5.gif" height="127" width="183">The Ghhhk has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 4, <b>Defense</b> 3, <b>Movement</b> 2.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image6.gif" height="130" width="191">The Houjix has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 4, <b>Defense</b> 4, <b>Movement</b> 1.</p>

<p>After these, there are two Defensive pieces, the Kirtan Strider and
the Ng’ok which have high defense ratings and low attack ratings.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/Image7.gif" height="132" width="191">The Strider has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 2, <b>Defense</b> 7, <b>Movement</b> 3.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image8.gif" height="125" width="181">The Ng’ok has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 3, <b>Defense</b> 8, <b>Movement</b> 1.</p>

<p>Finally, there are two Offensive pieces, the K’lor’slug and the Molator, which have high attack ratings and low defense ratings.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image9.gif" height="144" width="212">
The K’lor’slug has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 7, <b>Defense</b> 3, <b>Movement</b> 2.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/Image10.gif" height="150" width="220">The Molator has the ratings of <b>Attack</b> 8, <b>Defense</b> 2, <b>Movement</b> 2.</p>

<p>(Note that these are only the most common pieces, a wide variety of
additional sets of pieces can be purchased, with everything from
starships to droids to mythical warriors to gravball personalities to
current politicians. [The latter are particular popular, simply for
exchanges like "Let’s see… I’ll move Leia 2 spaces clockwise and attack
Borsk Fey’lya… prepare to die, Bothan Boy!"] These new pieces may also
come with different sets of capabilities. Check the instructions that
come with the alternate piece-sets for more information.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Object of Dejarik is to destroy all the opponents pieces, before
the opponent can destroy yours. <p><img src="index_files/Image11.gif" height="163" width="163">                           <i><u>Diagram 2</u></i></p>
<i><u></u></i><u></u>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the computer randomly divides the
pieces between the players, and places them on opposites sides of the
board, in the four spaces closest to the respective players (See
Diagram 2). Each game a player may have different pieces on his side,
so it is important to know the capabilities of each playing piece.</p>

<p>After the pieces appear, the players decide who will have the first
move, often by flipping a coin. After that, play proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>During each turn, a player is allowed to take two consecutive
actions, which can be used to either move one of their pieces to a new
space, or to attack an opponent’s piece. (So, during a turn, a player
may move a piece twice, or may attack two other pieces, or move and
then attack, or attack and then move.) However a player must use both
of their allotted actions each turn.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/Image12.gif" height="221" width="221"></p>
<i><p>Legal and illegal moves for a piece with a Move Rating of 3</p>
</i><b>
</b><p><b>Moving:</b> When moving a piece across the game board, the
piece must be moved its full amount of spaces designated by its
movement rating. For example, when moving the Strider, the player must
move the piece 3 spaces, and may not move it only 2 or 1 in order to
place it in a more favorable position. When moving, a piece may move to
any space adjacent to its own [either around the orbit or along the
ray]’ but cannot move diagonally, or into a space occupied by another
piece (See Diagram 3)</p>

<b></b><p><b>Attacking: </b>If a player has positioned one of his
pieces adjacent to an opposing piece (assuming he has an action
remaining in his turn), the player may declare an attack on that piece.</p>

<p>The results of the attack are calculated by the computer, using the
piece’s attack rating versus the opposing piece’s defense rating. (Even
though the battle results are decided randomly, the computer’s
calculations are based on the ratings of the pieces. Thus, the Savirp
would have an even chance of against the Ng’ok, but a 4 to 1 advantage
over the Ghhhk.)</p>

<p>There are four possible outcomes to an attack, determined by the computer:</p>

<ol>

<li>The player’s piece may destroy his opponent’s. This is
appropriately known as a "kill". These kill sequences can be very
graphic (except in children’s versions), which realistic animations and
sound effects. Afters this, the opponent’s piece is removed from the
board, but the attack piece remains in its present space.</li>
<li>The player’s piece may beat its opponent’s piece by a very small
margin. This results in a "push". Strategically, pushing is one of the
most important parts of the game. In a push, the attacker "pushes" his
opponent’s piece to any open adjacent space, either to block other
pieces, to set the piece up for an easy kill, or to simply get it out
of the way.</li>
<li>The Opponent’s piece may tie or beat the player’s piece by a small
margin. This is called a "counter-push". This works the same way as a
push, except hat the opponent is now pushing the attacking piece into
an open adjacent space.</li>
<li>The opponent’s piece may destroy the players piece. This is known
as a "counter-kill", and can often change the strategy of the entire
match.</li></ol>


<b></b><p><b>To-The-Death:</b> If each player only has one piece
remaining on the board, a final confrontation occurs. The two pieces
move to the center of the board, and battle To-The-Death. Each piece
uses its highest rating (be it Attack or Defense) to determine the
outcome. If the first round does not result in a kill, then the same
process is repeated, until only one is left standing. This player has
won the game.</p>

<i><p>RPG Notes: Obviously, there isn’t a "computer" to decide the
outcome of each attack, so you’ll need to use dice instead. It’s really
very simple. The attacker rolls his piece’s Attack rating versus the
opposing piece Defense rating. (For instance, if the K’lor’slug
attacked the Houjix, then the K’lor’slug would roll 7D to attack and
the Houjix would roll 4D to defend.)</p>

<p><i>It’s easy enough to draw your own board and pieces. Otherwise you
could print out the board from Diagram 1 (which is displayed at half
size) and a set of sample pieces. You could even tape these game pieces
to chess pieces or miniatures for a more three dimensional effect.</i></p>
<i></i>
<b><p>An Example Game of Dejarik:</p>

</b><p>Chewbacca and Rd-D2 are playing Dejarik during the long trip to Alderaan.</p>

<p>The game is started, and Chewie smugly allows R2 the first move. The
pieces come up, and the holograms immediately begin taunting and
snarling at one another. Chewie ended up with (From left to right in
his starting spaces) the Monnok, the Molator, the Kirtan Strider, and
K’lor’slug, while R2 received the Ghhhk, the Houjix, the Mantellian
Savrip, and the Ng’ok. (Notice that R2 ended up with both of the
mid-range pieces, setting his at a slight disadvantage from the very
beginning.)</p>

<p>As his first move, the astromech droid moves the Ng’ok one space
counter-clockwise around the outer orbit, in order ot interfere with
Chewie’s most dangerous piece, the Monnok. As his second move, R2 moves
the Houjix into the central space, a very common opening move.</p>

<p>Then the Wookiee takes his turn, and he decides to move his Strider
(on space in, 2 spaces clockwise, followed by three more spaces
clockwise). This places his piece on R2’s side of the board, directly
behind the Houjix. Remember that the Strider is a Defensive piece.
Chewie is using a bold but not uncommon strategy, trying to bait R2
into attacking his strongest defender.</p>

<p>Chewbacca sits back grinning, while C-3PO, kibitzing, advises his counterpart to be careful.</p>

<p>R2 responds by moving his Savrip into position, and then using it to
attack Chewbacca’s Strider. Chewbacca expects a victory, or at least a
push. The computer makes the calculations. Surprisingly, the Savrip
wins, and proceeds to snap the Strider’s spine and cackle over it’s
limp course. [Chewie rolled an 24, R2 got a 31]</p>

<p>"RWWAAAAH!!!"	<b>							</b></p>
<b></b><p>"He made a fair move. Screaming about it wont help you."</p>

<p>After a brief discussion with Han, C-3PO advises a new strategy:
"Let the Wookiee win." Chewbacca chuckles and contemplates his next
move….</p>

<b><u></u></b><p><b><u>Rules of Courtier:</u></b></p>

<b><u></u></b><u></u><p>Courtier is played with a set of 12 pieces, 6
of one color and 6 of another. The players site on opposites sides of
the board, and each control the 6 pieces of their respective colors.
Each colored set consists of 5 Guards and one King.<br>                                 <i><u>Diagram 4</u></i></p>
<i><u></u></i><u></u><img src="index_files/Image13.gif" height="190" width="190">

<p>At the beginning of the game, the pieces are laid out along the 6
spaces of the board’s outer orbit that are closest to the player, with
the King being placed ion each player’s immediate right (the 3<sup>rd</sup> space from clockwise). (See Diagram 4)</p>

<p>The object of Courtier is to capture the opponent’s King, before the opponent captures your own.</p>

<p>Unlike in Dejarik, each player moves only once per turn, and each piece may only move one space at a time.</p>
<dir><i><u></u></i><p><i><u>Diagram 5</u></i></p></dir>
<i><u></u></i><u></u>
<p><img src="index_files/Image14.gif" height="247" width="247"><br>Most
Courtier sets have holographic pieces in the form of nobles and
guardsmen or warriors dressed in traditional style. The King should be
easily distinguishable from the more nondescript and armed Guard
pieces. Once the pieces appear on the board, the players must decide
between them who will have the first move. Traditionally, blue has the
first move. However, the opening move can often have a very important
effect on the player’s overall strategy. Because of this, many
holochess boards now come with a simple randomizer which determines who
will begin the game.</p>

<p>Once the game begins, the play is fairly simple In a turn, a player
selects one of his pieces and moves it into an adjacent space, either
around the orbit or along the ray. Moving diagonally, or into a space
already occupied by another piece, is not allowed. If a capture occurs,
the appropriate piece is removed from the board. Otherwise, the
opposite player takes a turn, and so on, until one of the player’s King
is captured.</p>


<p><b>Capturing:</b> A capture occurs when a player surrounds an enemy
piece with two of his own. All three pieces must be on the same orbit
or the same ray. A capture occurs ONLY when three pieces are involved
(both Guards and Kings may be used to capture). You cannot capture two
or three enemy pieces at a time (See Diagram 5) After a capture, the
captured piece is removed from the board. If the captured piece is a
Guard, then play passes to the other player. If the captured piece is
the opponent’s King, then the game is over, and the player has won the
game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="index_files/Image15.gif" height="212" width="212"><i><u>Diagram 6</u></i></p>
<i><u></u></i><p><i>Red player moves piece as shown. Both inside pieces are removed.</i></p>

<i></i><b></b><p><b>Double-Capturing:</b> A special case of capture
rules is when a player moves his piece into a position where he could
capture an opponents piece but also be captured himself. (See Diagram
6) When this occurs, both pieces are considered captured and are
removed from the board.</p>

<b><p>General Strategy Tips:</p>
</b><p>The central space is the pivotal position. Controlling it early
gives you an advantage, but it leaves you open for devastating
double-captures if you aren’t careful.</p>


<ul>
<li>In the early stages of the game, you King is very difficult to
capture. Defensive players usually keep their King on the outer orbit,
with another piece nearby. However, if you start to run low on pieces,
remember that your King can be used to capture just as any other piece.</li>
<li>Think ahead before jumping into double-captures. They may lead you
taking control of the center of the board, but going around them often
puts you in a better strategic position.</li>
<li>If you find that the enemy has control of the central space and is
trapping all your pieces on one side of the board, don’t give up. Keep
shifting your pieces. Unless your opponent is an expert, it isn’t too
difficult to evade the trap as it’s closing and then maneuver in
behind, especially if the enemy is low on pieces.</li></ul>
